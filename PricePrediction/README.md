# Price Predection

## :heavy_check_mark: Task
The Main task here is to predict the Price of the houses by using some of the given features.

The main thing is to reduce the Error in the model.

### :thought_balloon: Approach
First I am going to make a model using the basic and all the features in the dataset. I shall use multiple Algorithms to make the model and test each of the Model's Accuracy and Error in a [file](ScoreRecord.txt).

After that I will try to create some important ratios that would have good co-relation with the proce and try to drop different Feature and record the model accuracy and error in different scenioeo.

## Model 
This is going to be a Supervised Regression model to predict the price of the Houses from the [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/notebook)

Multiple model is going to be used in this Predection Model.
