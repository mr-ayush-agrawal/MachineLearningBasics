## Project Approach 
This is from the section of the video where its been taught how to approach the real world project and work on the real world dataset.

## Tasks
All the tasks performed here are taken from the [**New York City Taxi Fare Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data?select=sample_submission.csv) which is a previously hosted competition on Kaggle and we will try to solve and answer the Questions asked there.

The Task is to predict the fare of the taxiin the New York City.

### Sourcing Data
We can directly download the dataset form kaggle by using `opendataset` library, and by passing our kaggle username and API Token.

## Solutions
I am using the Kaggle Note book for the purpose as this is very large dataset and can't be handdle here in the PC.
